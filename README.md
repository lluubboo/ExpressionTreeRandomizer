# ExpressionTreeRandomizer
Header-only library has the capability for the random generation of expression trees with subsequent evaluation. The tree is generated based on the formula proposed by Mr. Arnold and Sleep in 1980. The tree generation operates in O(n) time complexity, and each possible shape of the tree is equally probable.

The library requires the Eigen library, because is specifically designed for vector calculations for symbolic regression.
